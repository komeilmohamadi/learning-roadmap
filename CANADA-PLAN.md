# Canada Immigration & Career Roadmap

This document describes my long-term, structured plan to become a job-ready backend / full-stack developer and successfully immigrate to Canada through a skilled work or study pathway.

The roadmap focuses on three parallel pillars:
- Software Engineering (Backend / Full-Stack)
- English Language Proficiency (IELTS – CLB 9+)
- Immigration Readiness (documents, profile, and timing)

This plan is designed to be realistic, flexible, and resilient to life constraints such as limited time or mandatory service.

## Language Strategy (Important)

Language is treated as a **daily discipline**, not a short-term goal.

Principles:
- English every day (even 15–30 minutes)
- Writing and Speaking prioritized
- Error logs maintained
- No exam booking until mock scores are stable

CLB 9 is treated as a **minimum professional requirement**, not just an immigration checkbox.

---

## Time Management & Constraints

This plan accounts for:
- Possible military service
- Reduced daily study time
- Mental fatigue
- Real-life interruptions

Rules:
- Consistency > intensity
- Never fully stop (even on busy days)
- Output-focused learning
- Finish small things instead of starting many

The plan is designed so progress slows down under pressure, but never breaks.

---

## Documentation & Tracking

All progress is documented via:
- Daily logs
- Stage-based folders
- Git commit history
- Error logs
- Periodic reviews

This ensures:
- Clear proof of progress
- Strong portfolio narrative
- Easier resume and interview preparation

---

## Mindset

This is a long-term plan built on:
- Discipline over motivation
- Depth over speed
- Skill over certificates
- Real ability over surface knowledge

The goal is not just immigration, but building a sustainable professional life in a new country.

## Final Note

This roadmap is a living document.
It will evolve as skills grow, opportunities appear, and conditions change.

The core principles, however, will remain:
**Consistency, clarity, and craftsmanship.**
