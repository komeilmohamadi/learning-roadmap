## 2026-02-02 — Day 2 (Git)

### Focus
Git Branching, Merge, and Conflict Resolution

### What I did
- Created a feature branch and made meaningful commits
- Merged changes into main
- Simulated a merge conflict and resolved it manually
- Cleaned up merged branches

### Output
- Notes: stage-0-git/DAY2.md
- Repo updated with merge + conflict resolution commits

### Commands practiced
git checkout -b <branch>
git switch <branch>
git merge <branch>
git branch -d <branch>

### Problems / Fixes
- Faced an add/add conflict in DAY2.md → resolved by manually combining contents and committing.

### Next
Day 3: rebase, stash, clean history
