# Career Roadmap — Backend & Full-Stack Development

This document describes my structured, long-term career roadmap as a backend and full-stack developer.

I have **approximately two years of hands-on experience** in full-stack web development.  
This repository and roadmap exist to **rebuild foundations, standardize my skills, and document continuous professional growth** in a clean, transparent way.

The focus of this roadmap is not short-term goals, but sustainable skill development aligned with real-world software engineering standards.

## Background & Experience

- ~2 years of experience as a Full-Stack Developer
- Experience with frontend and backend technologies
- Familiarity with real project workflows
- This roadmap is used to:
  - Revisit fundamentals deeply
  - Fill knowledge gaps
  - Improve structure, consistency, and best practices
  - Build a strong public learning and portfolio narrative

---

## Core Focus Areas

This roadmap is built on three professional pillars:

### 1. Software Engineering (Backend / Full-Stack)
- Strong fundamentals over shortcuts
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Backend-first mindset with full-stack capability
- Realistic project workflows and documentation

### 2. English for Professional & Technical Use
- English treated as a professional skill
- Focus on:
  - Technical reading and documentation
  - Writing clear explanations and comments
  - Confident communication in technical contexts
- Continuous practice alongside coding

### 3. Career Growth & Job Readiness
- Building a portfolio that reflects real skills
- Clean Git history and meaningful commits
- Strong README files and documentation
- Interview readiness through understanding, not memorization

## Timeline Overview (High-Level)

This roadmap is intentionally flexible and adaptable.

### Phase 1 — Foundation Rebuild
- Git & GitHub (professional workflows)
- HTML & CSS (structure, layout, standards)
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Clean development environment and tooling

### Phase 2 — Backend Strengthening
- Backend fundamentals (Node.js / PHP)
- REST APIs
- Databases (MySQL)
- Authentication & security basics
- Error handling and clean architecture concepts

### Phase 3 — Full-Stack & Production Mindset
- Frontend framework (React)
- State management
- Full-stack applications
- Testing basics
- Deployment and environment awareness

## Output & Documentation Strategy

All progress is documented through:
- Stage-based folders (e.g. `stage-0-git`, `stage-1-html-css`)
- Day-by-day learning notes
- Daily logs summarizing work and focus
- Clean and descriptive commit messages
- Error logs to track mistakes and lessons learned

This documentation serves as:
- Proof of consistency and discipline
- A transparent learning and improvement history
- A portfolio narrative for recruiters and teams

---

## Time Management Philosophy

This roadmap is designed to work under real-life constraints:
- Variable daily time
- Mental fatigue
- Busy periods or rest days

Rules:
- Consistency over intensity
- Progress is allowed to slow down, but not stop
- Small, finished outputs are preferred over unfinished complexity

---

## Mindset & Principles

This roadmap is built on:
- Discipline over motivation
- Depth over speed
- Understanding over memorization
- Long-term growth over short-term pressure

The goal is not to “learn everything fast”, but to **become reliably good**.

---

## Final Note

This roadmap is a living document.
It will evolve as my skills grow and priorities change.

The core principles will remain:
**Consistency, clarity, and craftsmanship.**
