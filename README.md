# Learning Roadmap

This repository documents my journey to become a job-ready backend and full-stack developer.

## Goals
- Learn Git & GitHub professionally
- Build real-world projects
- Prepare for future job opportunities

## Day 2 — Git Branch, Merge & Conflict

Practiced professional Git workflows including branching, merging, and resolving merge conflicts using a real repository.

### What I learned
- Creating and managing branches
- Switching between branches
- Merging feature branches into main
- Understanding fast-forward vs merge commit
- Creating and resolving merge conflicts
- Cleaning up merged branches

### Implementation
- Notes & practice: [`stage-0-git/DAY2.md`](stage-0-git/DAY2.md)
- Conflict simulation and resolution committed to main branch

### Reflection
Learning how to resolve merge conflicts manually helped me understand how teams collaborate safely on shared codebases.
