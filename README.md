## Day 5 — GitHub Collaboration, README & Versioning

Completed advanced GitHub workflows including documentation, collaboration, and versioning.

### What I learned
- Writing professional README files using Markdown
- Using Markdown syntax for headings, lists, tables, links, and code blocks
- Adding repository badges with shields.io
- Managing collaborators in private repositories
- Working with Pull Requests from feature branches
- Forking repositories and contributing via Pull Requests
- Using .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Creating and managing Git tags for versioning and releases

### Implementation
- Notes & practice: [`stage-0-git/DAY5.md`](stage-0-git/DAY5.md)

### Reflection
Learning collaboration workflows and versioning practices made me more confident to work on real-world and open-source projects.

## Day 6 — HTML Foundations & Environment Setup

Started **Stage 1 (HTML & CSS)** and focused on setting up the development environment and learning core HTML concepts.

### What I learned
- Efficient usage of Visual Studio Code (search, replace, extensions, shortcuts)
- Understanding file types used in web development (.html, .css, .js, .php)
- Core HTML structure and essential tags
- Difference between container tags and self-closing tags
- HTML attributes (global vs tag-specific)
- Basic CSS concepts and inline styling

### Implementation
- Notes & practice: [`stage-1-html-css/DAY6.md`](stage-1-html-css/DAY6.md)

### Reflection
Building a strong foundation in HTML and tooling is essential before moving into layout, styling, and JavaScript.
## Day 7 — CSS Selectors, Box Model, Display & Flexbox Basics

Expanded CSS fundamentals with internal styling, advanced selectors, and layout basics including display modes and flexbox.

### What I learned
- Internal CSS using `<style>` and clean rule structure
- CSS selectors (class, id, combinators, universal, attribute selectors)
- Box model (margin/padding/default spacing) and DevTools inspection
- Display modes (block/inline/inline-block/none)
- Flexbox fundamentals (justify-content, align-items)
- Pseudo-classes (:hover, :active, :first-child, :last-child, :nth-child, :only-child)

### Implementation
- Notes & practice: [`stage-1-html-css/DAY7.md`](stage-1-html-css/DAY7.md)
## Day 8 — CSS Flexbox Deep Dive & Practical Layouts

Focused on strengthening layout skills by going deeper into Flexbox and building practical, real-world layouts.

### What I learned
- Flexbox axis model (main axis vs cross axis)
- `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, and `flex-flow`
- `justify-content` vs `align-items` vs `align-content`
- Using `gap` instead of margins in flex layouts
- Flex item properties (`flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`)
- Proper centering techniques with Flexbox
- Common Flexbox layout patterns (navbar, cards, columns)

### Implementation
- Notes & practice: [`stage-1-html-css/DAY8.md`](stage-1-html-css/DAY8.md)

### Reflection
Flexbox finally feels predictable instead of trial-and-error.
Understanding axes and item behavior made layout debugging much easier.
