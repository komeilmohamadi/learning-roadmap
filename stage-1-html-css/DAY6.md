# Day 6 — HTML Foundations & Development Environment Setup

## What I practiced
- Setting up a clean development environment
- Reviewing VS Code core features for efficient coding
- Learning HTML fundamentals and core tags
- Understanding CSS basics and inline styling

---

## Development Environment

### Tools
- Visual Studio Code
- Browser (for live preview)

### VS Code Basics
- File & folder structure overview
- Collapsing folders in Explorer
- Search panel (`Ctrl + Shift + F`)
- Replace functionality (`Ctrl + H`)
- Undo / Redo
- Duplicate line (`Alt + Shift + Arrow Down`)
- Toggle line comment
- Installing and managing extensions

---

## File Types & Examples
Practiced creating and working with:
- `.html`
- `.css`
- `.js`
- `.php`

All files were created and tested inside VS Code to understand structure and workflow.

## HTML Fundamentals

### Core Structure Tags
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` (no closing tag)
- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<body>`

---

## HTML Tags Overview

### Tags with closing tag
- Headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- Paragraph: `<p>`
- Anchor (link): `<a>`
- Textarea
- Button
- Division: `<div>` (layout & structure)

### Self-closing / void tags
- Image: `<img>`
- Input: `<input>`

---

## Attributes

### Specific attributes
- `src` → for `<img>`
- `href` → for `<a>`

### Global attributes
- `title`
- `style`

## Inline Styling (CSS Basics)

### Common inline properties
- `text-align`
- `font-size`
- `font-family`
- `margin` (top, right, bottom, left)
- `padding`

### Fonts discussed

## CSS Basics

### What is CSS?
CSS is used to control the layout, appearance, and visual style of HTML elements.

### Inline CSS
- Using the `style` attribute directly inside HTML elements
- Understanding why inline CSS is not scalable (but useful for learning)

---

## Language Practice
- English study sessions: 5 lessons completed
- Focus: basic understanding and continuity

---

## Reflection
Setting up the development environment and revisiting HTML/CSS fundamentals helped establish a strong foundation for the full-stack learning path.
