# Day 10 — PHP Fundamentals

## What I practiced
- Setting up PHP local environment
- Writing basic PHP syntax
- Using variables and data types
- Working with strings and operators
- Storing and managing data with arrays

---

## PHP Local Environment Setup

### Goal
Prepare a local environment for running and testing PHP code without a real server.

### Key Concepts
- Running PHP locally
- Using XAMPP for Apache and PHP
- Writing code using Visual Studio Code

### Golden Rule
> Local environments are for learning and development, not production.

### Notes
- XAMPP installed and configured
- PHP extensions enabled in VS Code

---

## Variables in PHP

### Goal
Store and reuse data efficiently.

### Key Concepts
- All variables start with `$`
- Variable values can change
- Variables improve readability and maintainability

### Golden Rule
> Variable names should clearly describe their purpose.

---

## PHP Tags

### Goal
Understand PHP file structure.

### Key Concepts
- Closing PHP tag is optional if no HTML follows
- Closing tag can improve readability

### Golden Rule
> Code readability is more important than syntax enforcement.

---

## Variable Naming Conventions

### Goal
Write readable and maintainable code.

### Key Concepts
- Variable names must not start with numbers or special characters
- Names should not be random
- Use meaningful names

### camelCase Convention
- First word lowercase
- Next words capitalized

**Examples:**  
`userName`, `totalPrice`

---

## Data Types in PHP

### Goal
Understand how PHP handles different types of data.

### Common Data Types
- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean

### Concept
Each data type defines how data behaves in operations.

---

## Strings in PHP

### Goal
Work with text data.

### Key Concepts
- Strings use single or double quotes
- Strings can be concatenated

### Golden Rule
> Strings are the foundation of user-facing output.

### String Concatenation
- Dot (`.`) operator is used to combine strings

---

## Operators

### Goal
Perform operations on data.

### Key Concepts
- Operators perform actions
- Operands are values being operated on

### Operator Types
- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Increment and decrement operators

### Concept
Operators define how data is processed and modified.

---

## Arrays

### Goal
Store multiple related values in one variable.

### Key Concepts
- Arrays can hold mixed data types
- Indexing starts from 0

### Common Operations
- Access elements by index
- Display array content
- Count array items

---

## Final Summary
> PHP fundamentals such as variables, data types, strings, operators, and arrays form the core of every PHP application.
